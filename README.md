## What is Miriam?

Miriam is a cycle tracking app that provides science-backed guidance for training intensity, nutrition, and energy management based on your menstrual cycle phase. It's built with privacy as a core principle—your data never leaves your device.

### Key Features

- ** Cycle Tracking**: Track your menstrual cycle with visual calendar and phase indicators so you can plan accordingly
- ** Personalised Guidance**: Get adaptive recommendations for training, nutrition, and energy based on:
  - Current cycle phase (Menstrual, Follicular, Ovulatory, Early and Late Luteal)
  - Daily inputs (sleep quality, stress, energy levels)
  - Your unique patterns over time
- ** Privacy-First**: 100% local storage—no backend, no cloud, no data collection
- ** Body-Positive Language**: Supportive, stigma-free approach to cycle awareness

## Privacy Commitment

Your reproductive health data is sensitive. Miriam is designed with privacy at its core:

- **No backend servers**: All data stored in browser localStorage
- **No cloud sync**: Your data stays on your device, always
- **No accounts required**: No login, no tracking, no analytics
- **No data collection**: We literally cannot see your data
- **Open source**: Full transparency in how your data is handled

**Trade-off**: You must use the same device to access your data. There is no cross-device sync by design.

- Cycle tracking is not a reliable form of contraception
- If you have irregular cycles or conditions like PCOS, guidance may not fit your experience
- Listen to your body first, app recommendations second
