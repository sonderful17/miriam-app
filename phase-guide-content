MENSTRUAL PHASE GUIDE

What's Happening in Your Body
Hormones: Estrogen and progesterone drop to their lowest levels, triggering menstruation. Your body sheds the uterine lining built up during the previous cycle.
Duration: Typically days 1-5 (Day 1 = first day of bleeding)
How You Might Feel:
•	Lower energy and need for rest
•	Inward, reflective mood
•	Possible cramping, lower back pain, headaches
•	Less social energy
•	Relief once bleeding starts
The Science: Low hormone levels affect neurotransmitter production (serotonin, dopamine). Prostaglandins cause uterine contractions, which can trigger cramping and inflammation throughout the body. Your basal metabolic rate is at its lowest point.
 
Training During Menstruation
Why You Might Feel Different:
•	Pain tolerance is lower
•	Core temperature is lower
•	Overall energy is reduced
•	Inflammation may be elevated if cramping is present
What Works Well:
•	Gentle yoga, especially restorative or yin
•	Walking in nature
•	Stretching and mobility work
•	Light swimming 
•	Complete rest is also productive
What To Approach Carefully:
•	High-intensity exercise
•	Heavy lifting 
•	Long endurance efforts
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM: Your body is releasing and cleansing. Vigorous movement disperses Qi when it should be consolidating. Gentle movement helps Qi circulate without depleting it.
Ayurveda: Vata is dominant: you need grounding, not depletion. Restorative practices balance Vata's natural tendency toward exhaustion during menstruation.
Many People Find: Movement helps cramping (endorphins are natural pain relievers), but pushing too hard backfires. Listen to your body. Some days call for movement, others for rest.
 
Nutrition During Menstruation
Metabolic Context:
•	You're losing iron through bleeding (especially if flow is heavy)
•	Inflammation may be elevated
•	You may crave comfort foods (this is normal)
•	Digestive capacity may be lower
Prioritise:
•	Iron-rich foods: Red meat, liver, lentils, dark leafy greens, pumpkin seeds
•	Anti-inflammatory foods: Ginger, turmeric, fatty fish, cherries, berries
•	Magnesium: Dark chocolate, almonds, avocado (helps muscle relaxation)
•	Warming, easy-to-digest meals: Soups, stews, cooked vegetables
•	Adequate hydration: Helps reduce bloating
Consider limiting:
•	Caffeine (can worsen cramping)
•	High-sodium processed foods (can increase bloating)
•	Alcohol (affects hormone clearance and hydration)
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM:
•	Focus on building Blood: bone broth, red dates, goji berries, black sesame seeds
•	Warming foods support circulation: ginger tea, cinnamon, cooked foods
•	Avoid cold/raw foods which can "congeal" blood flow and worsen cramping
Ayurveda:
•	Vata-calming foods: warm, moist, grounding
•	Cooked grains, root vegetables, ghee, warm milk with spices
•	Avoid cold, dry, raw foods that aggravate Vata
 
Energy & Social
Why You Feel This Way: Low estrogen means lower serotonin and dopamine. Your body's natural rhythm is inviting introspection and rest.
What Supports You:
•	Saying no to social obligations without guilt
•	Journaling, creative reflection
•	Cozy, low-key activities
•	Time alone or with very close friends
•	Early bedtimes
•	Gentle self-compassion
Reframe: This is your body's natural time to reflect, process, and restore.

Meal Timing
Metabolic Considerations: Your body needs consistent fuel. Blood sugar regulation may be more challenging with low hormones. Fasting can trigger cortisol release when your body is already depleted.
Guidance:
•	Eat when hungry and honour your body's signals
•	Regular meals may help stabilise energy and mood
•	Focus on nourishment, not restriction
 
Common Experiences
•	Cramping: Prostaglandins cause uterine contractions. Magnesium, heat, gentle movement, and anti-inflammatory foods help.
•	Heavy first day: Often the body's "big release" as the estrogen drop triggers maximum shedding.
•	Lower back pain: Uterine contractions can radiate to lower back.
•	Headaches: Estrogen withdrawal can trigger migraines in susceptible people.
•	Brain fog: Lower hormones can temporarilty affect cognitive function.
•	Relief/release: Many people feel emotional or physical relief once bleeding starts, especially if PMS was intense.
 
FOLLICULAR PHASE GUIDE

What's Happening in Your Body
Hormones: Estrogen rises steadily from low to moderate-high levels. FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) causes several ovarian follicles to mature.
Duration: Typically days 6-13 (end of period through just before ovulation)
How You Might Feel:
•	Energy rising and rebuilding
•	Optimistic, motivated mood
•	Mental clarity improving
•	Creative and social energy returning
•	Ready to start new projects
The Science: Rising estrogen increases serotonin, dopamine, and acetylcholine production. It improves insulin sensitivity, enhances verbal skills and memory, and increases neuroplasticity. This is your brain's "spring", focus on growth and possibility.
 
Training During Follicular Phase
This Is Your Power Window:
•	Estrogen improves muscle protein synthesis
•	Insulin sensitivity is high (efficient carbohydrate metabolism)
•	Pain tolerance increases
•	Recovery is faster
•	Tendon and ligament strength improves
•	You can handle training volume better
What Works Well:
•	Heavy strength training - push for PRs
•	High-intensity interval training 
•	Plyometrics and explosive movements
•	Learning new skills (neuroplasticity is enhanced)
•	Increasing training volume
•	Longer cardio sessions
Progressive Overload: If you're going to add weight, reps, or intensity to your training, this is the phase to do it.
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM: This is the Yin-building phase. After the Blood phase, your body is nourishing and rebuilding. Yang is starting to emerge. Movement should build strength and vitality.
Ayurveda: Kapha's building qualities dominate. Your body is strong and can handle more. Use this grounded energy for strength-building.
 
Nutrition During Follicular Phase
Metabolic Context:
•	Insulin sensitivity is high, your body uses carbohydrates efficiently
•	Metabolic rate is lower (compared to luteal)
•	Your body is rebuilding after menstruation
•	Digestion is typically strong
Prioritise:
•	Quality carbohydrates: Quinoa, sweet potatoes, oats, rice, sprouted grains
•	Lean proteins: Chicken, fish, eggs, legumes (support muscle building)
•	Fresh vegetables: Your digestion can handle raw foods well now
•	Fermented foods: Kimchi, kefir, sauerkraut (support estrogen metabolism)
•	Cruciferous vegetables: Broccoli, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts (help metabolise estrogen)
•	Light, fresh meals: Smoothies, salads, grain bowls
Nutrient Focus:
•	B vitamins (energy production)
•	Zinc (supports follicle development)
•	Antioxidants (berries, leafy greens)
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM:
•	Build Yin and Blood: eggs, bone broth, seaweed, dark leafy greens
•	Lighter cooking methods: steaming, light sautéing
•	Green vegetables, sprouts, fresh foods 
•	Nourish Kidney and Liver: black beans, beets, carrots
Ayurveda:
•	Kapha-balancing: light, fresh, not overly heavy
•	Favor bitter, astringent, pungent tastes
•	Fresh vegetables, whole grains, legumes
•	Light proteins, warming spices
 
Energy & Social
Why You Feel This Way: Rising estrogen boosts neurotransmitters associated with motivation, connection, and optimism. Your verbal skills, memory, and social cognition are enhanced.
What Supports You:
•	Starting new projects or initiatives
•	Social gatherings and networking
•	Creative brainstorming
•	Learning new skills
•	Having important conversations
•	Scheduling meetings or presentations
•	Dating or new social connections
Harness This Energy: This is your planning and initiation phase. What do you want to accomplish this cycle? Set your intentions and start building momentum.
 
Meal Timing
Metabolic Considerations: High insulin sensitivity means your body efficiently manages glucose. Your metabolism is at its most flexible and your body can switch between fuel sources easily.
Guidance:
•	Your body can handle lower meal frequency
•	Still listen to hunger cues, flexibility is key
•	Good time to experiment with meal timing if curious
Many People Find: Fasting feels easier during follicular phase. But "can tolerate" doesn't mean "should do", eat intuitively.
 
Common Experiences
•	Increased libido: Rising estrogen and testosterone increase sex drive
•	Clearer skin: Estrogen improves skin quality 
•	Better sleep: Earlier in phase, before estrogen peaks
•	Heightened senses: Taste, smell, and hearing may be enhanced
•	Optimism bias: You may take on too much, pace yourself
•	Cervical fluid changes: Discharge increases and becomes clearer as ovulation approaches
 
OVULATORY PHASE GUIDE
What's Happening in Your Body
Hormones: Estrogen peaks, then drops rapidly. LH (luteinising hormone) surges, triggering ovulation. Testosterone also rises. Progesterone begins to climb after ovulation.
Duration: Typically days 14-16 (roughly 3 days around ovulation)
How You Might Feel:
•	Peak energy and confidence
•	Maximum social and communication skills
•	Heightened senses and awareness
•	Strong, capable, charismatic
•	Elevated mood and libido
The Science: Peak estrogen enhances communication centers in the brain, increases dopamine and serotonin, and heightens emotional attunement. Testosterone increases strength and assertiveness. You're biologically primed for connection and performance. 
 
Training During Ovulation
Why This Is Peak Performance:
•	Maximum pain tolerance (you can push hardest now)
•	Peak strength and power output
•	Highest testosterone of your entire cycle
•	Estrogen still elevated (muscle protein synthesis strong)
•	Coordination and reaction time are optimal
•	You recover quickly
What Works Well:
•	Maximum effort workouts
•	HIIT and Tabata
•	Heavy compound lifts
•	Competitive sports or group fitness
•	Testing your limits - PRs, races, competitions
•	Plyometrics and power training
•	Long, challenging runs or rides
This Is Your Window: If you're going to do something that scares you physically, this is the time. Your body can handle it.
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM: Peak Yang energy. The "transition" point in the cycle - Yin has been built, now Yang surges. This is the most dynamic phase. Vigorous movement is appropriate.
Ayurveda: Pitta dominant - fire element is high. You have heat, intensity, and drive. Channel it into strong practice but don't overheat.
Many People Find: Workouts that felt hard during menstruation feel easy now. Your body wants to move intensely.
 
Nutrition During Ovulation
Metabolic Context:
•	Metabolism is transitioning (starting to rise)
•	Insulin sensitivity remains good
•	Digestion is strong - your gut can handle variety
•	Estrogen supports gut motility
•	You may have increased appetite as ovulation completes
Prioritise:
•	Fiber-rich foods: Raw vegetables, fruits, whole grains (gut handles this well)
•	Antioxidants: Berries, colorful vegetables (support egg quality)
•	Omega-3s: Fatty fish, walnuts, flax (anti-inflammatory)
•	Cruciferous vegetables: Broccoli, kale, cabbage (support estrogen metabolism)
•	Lighter proteins: Fish, chicken, legumes
•	Raw foods: Salads, smoothies, fresh fruits
Nutrient Focus:
•	Vitamin C (supports progesterone production for upcoming luteal phase)
•	Glutathione-rich foods (asparagus, avocado)
•	B vitamins (energy metabolism)
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM:
•	Cooling foods balance peak Yang: cucumber, watermelon, leafy greens
•	Continue nourishing Blood: red dates, goji berries
•	Light, fresh foods align with peak energy
•	Avoid overly spicy or heating foods
Ayurveda:
•	Pitta-balancing foods: cooling, sweet, bitter
•	Coconut, cilantro, cucumber, mint
•	Avoid excessive spicy, salty, or acidic foods
•	Fresh fruits, leafy greens, coconut water
Common Wisdom: You can eat anything during this phase, digestion is strong. But cooling, fresh foods may feel better than heavy meals.
 
Energy & Social
Why You Feel This Way: Peak estrogen enhances verbal fluency, emotional intelligence, and social bonding. You're at your most charismatic and confident. 
What Supports You:
•	Social events and parties
•	Date nights
•	Creative collaboration
•	Networking events or conferences
•	Leading meetings 
Harness This Energy: Schedule high-stakes social or professional events during this window. You're naturally persuasive, articulate, and confident.
 
Meal Timing
Metabolic Considerations: Your metabolic flexibility is at its peak. You can fast, eat frequently, or anything in between - your body adapts easily.
Guidance:
•	Intuitive eating works well now
•	Your body will signal clearly when it needs fuel
•	Complete flexibility - do what feels good
Many People Find: Hunger cues are clear and easy to honour during this phase. Trust your body.
 
Common Experiences
•	Peak libido: Biological drive for sex is highest
•	Heightened attraction: You may find others more attractive (and they find you more attractive: pheromones!)
•	Cervical fluid: Clear, stretchy, "egg white" consistency (most fertile)
•	Increased energy: Even if you don't sleep as much, you feel good and capable of anything
•	Confidence: You feel capable of anything
•	Social magnetism: Conversations flow easily
 
EARLY LUTEAL PHASE GUIDE
What's Happening in Your Body
Hormones: Progesterone begins rising after ovulation and climbs steadily. Estrogen rises again (secondary peak) but stays lower than ovulation. Both hormones are elevated together.
Duration: Typically days 17-23 (roughly first week after ovulation)
How You Might Feel:
•	Energy is still good, just moderated from ovulation peak
•	Productive, task-oriented focus
•	Appetite starts increasing
•	Mood is steady, perhaps more introspective
•	Still capable and functional
The Science: Progesterone has a calming, slightly sedating effect (it converts to allopregnanolone, a GABA-like compound). It raises body temperature slightly and increases metabolic rate by 100-300 calories per day. You're still riding some estrogen benefits, so this phase can feel quite stable and productive.
 
Training During Early Luteal
Why You Feel Different:
•	Body temperature rises slightly (progesterone effect)
•	Recovery takes a bit longer than follicular/ovulatory
•	You may overheat more easily during workouts
•	Strength maintenance is very doable
•	Not quite peak performance, but still strong
What Works Well:
•	Moderate-intensity strength training
•	Pilates or barre classes
•	Swimming 
•	Steady-state cardio (not sprints)
•	Power walking or hiking
•	Cycling at moderate pace
What To Approach Carefully:
•	Very long endurance efforts 
•	Back-to-back sessions (recovery needs increase)
•	Training in very hot conditions
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM: Yang is still present but Qi begins to consolidate. The expansive energy of ovulation transitions to a more focused, inward-moving quality. Moderate movement supports smooth Qi flow.
Ayurveda: Transitioning from Pitta to Vata. The fire element is cooling, air element increasing. Stay grounded with steady practice.
Many People Find: Workouts still feel good, just not as effortless as follicular phase. This is normal, honour the shift.
 
Nutrition During Early Luteal
Metabolic Context:
•	Metabolic rate begins rising 
•	Insulin sensitivity starts to decrease slightly
•	Appetite naturally increases
•	Body temperature is higher
•	Digestion remains fairly strong
Prioritise:
•	Complex carbohydrates: Quinoa, lentils, sweet potatoes, whole grain toast, brown rice
•	Protein with meals: Salmon, chicken, tempeh, eggs (helps with satiety)
•	Healthy fats: Avocado, nuts, nut butters, olive oil
•	Magnesium-rich snacks: Pumpkin seeds, almonds, dark chocolate
•	B-vitamin foods: Chickpeas, poultry, potatoes, bananas
•	Satisfying, complete meals: Your body needs more fuel
What's Happening: Your body isn't "hungrier for no reason", your metabolic rate has genuinely increased. Eat more.
Traditional Perspectives:
TCM:
•	Continue Blood nourishment: bone broth, red dates, dark leafy greens
•	Begin incorporating more warming foods: root vegetables, cooked grains
•	Smooth Qi flow: citrus, rose tea, fennel
•	Avoid excessive cold/raw foods as body temperature rises
Ayurveda:
•	Grounding Vata foods become more important: warm, cooked, nourishing
•	Root vegetables, rice, warming spices, ghee
•	Sweet, sour, salty tastes
•	Avoid excessive dry, cold, or light foods

Energy & Social
Why You Feel This Way: Progesterone's calming neurotransmitter effects create a more centered, focused energy. You're past the social sparkle of ovulation but still mentally sharp and productive.
What Supports You:
•	Completing projects started during follicular phase
•	Detail-oriented work and admin tasks
•	Organising and planning
•	Small gatherings with close friends (not large parties)
•	Home projects and nesting activities
•	Creative work that requires focus
Harness This Energy: This is your "finishing" energy. Great time to tie up loose ends, organise, and complete tasks that need sustained attention.
 
Meal Timing
Metabolic Considerations: Insulin sensitivity is slightly lower than follicular/ovulatory. Appetite is increasing. Your body needs more frequent nourishment as metabolic rate rises.
Guidance:
•	Pay close attention to hunger signals
•	Regular meals help stabilise energy
•	Satisfying snacks are appropriate
•	Don't push long fasts - your body needs fuel
Many People Find: Listen to your body. If you're genuinely hungry, eat.
 
Common Experiences
•	Increased appetite: Totally normal as metabolic rate has risen
•	Slight breast tenderness: Progesterone effect, usually mild in early luteal
•	Warmer body temperature: You may prefer cooler environments
•	Stable mood: The calm before potential PMS
•	Good sleep: Progesterone can be sleep-promoting
•	Shift toward introversion: Social battery depletes faster than ovulatory phase
 
LATE LUTEAL PHASE GUIDE
What's Happening in Your Body
Hormones: Progesterone and estrogen both drop sharply in the days before your period. This hormonal crash is what triggers PMS symptoms.
Duration: Typically days 24-28 (final 5ish days before period starts)
How You Might Feel:
•	Energy plummeting
•	Mood swings, irritability, or weepiness
•	Strong cravings (especially carbs and sweets)
•	Bloating and breast tenderness
•	Fatigue and need for rest
•	Low frustration tolerance
•	Desire to withdraw socially
The Science: When progesterone and estrogen drop rapidly, so do their calming and mood-boosting effects. Serotonin and dopamine decrease, triggering carb cravings and mood changes. GABA (calming neurotransmitter) is affected. 
 
Training During Late Luteal
Why Everything Feels Harder:
•	Hormone withdrawal affects energy profoundly
•	Motivation decreases (dopamine is lower)
•	Your body genuinely needs rest
•	Intense training adds stress when your system is already stressed
•	Recovery capacity is lowest
What Works Well:
•	Rest Days
•	Walking 
•	Gentle, restorative yoga
•	Stretching and foam rolling
•	Light pilates or barre (no intense variations)
What To Avoid:
•	Heavy lifting
•	Long endurance sessions
•	Anything that feels like pushing through
Traditional Perspectives:
TCM: Qi and Blood are turning deeply inward, preparing for menstruation. This is the time for consolidation and rest. Forcing Yang activity depletes reserves.
Ayurveda: Vata is high and increasing - you need grounding, warmth, and stillness. Movement should be gentle and supportive, never depleting.
Many People Find: Even a walk can feel like effort. This is normal. Your body is working hard internally. Rest is productive work.
 
Nutrition During Late Luteal
Metabolic Context:
•	Metabolic rate is STILL elevated 
•	Serotonin drops sharply → intense carb and sweet cravings
•	Insulin sensitivity is lowest of the entire cycle
•	Restricting food makes PMS dramatically worse
Prioritise:
•	Complex carbohydrates: Oatmeal, whole grain bread, sweet potatoes (these support serotonin production)
•	Magnesium: Dark chocolate, lima beans, peas, avocado, sweet corn
•	Calcium: Research shows it may reduce PMS symptoms
•	B6 foods: Chickpeas, potatoes, bananas (supports neurotransmitter production)
•	Satisfying, complete meals: Your body needs MORE food, not less
•	Whatever you're craving, in moderation: Honour your body's requests
CRITICAL: Restricting calories during late luteal makes PMS worse. You need around 10% extra to meet your body's increased needs.
Holistic Perspectives:
TCM:
•	Deeply nourishing Blood foods: bone broth, red meat, liver, dark leafy greens
•	Warming, grounding foods: slow-cooked stews, root vegetables, warming spices
•	Smooth Qi to prevent stagnation: ginger, rose, citrus peel
•	AVOID: cold, raw, or processed foods that stress digestion
Ayurveda:
•	Heavy Vata-calming foods: warm milk with ghee and spices, rice pudding, root vegetable curries
•	Sweet, sour, salty tastes to ground Vata
•	Cooked, warm, moist, slightly heavy foods
•	Avoid anything cold, dry, raw, or processed
 
Energy & Social
Why You Feel This Way: Plummeting estrogen and progesterone take serotonin, dopamine, and GABA with them. Your stress tolerance drops. Small annoyances feel huge. 
What You Need:
•	Permission to say NO to social obligations
•	Early bedtimes and naps
•	Quiet, alone time (or only with very safe people)
•	Cozy, comforting activities
•	Letting yourself cry if you need to
•	Minimal stimulation
•	Gentle self-compassion
Reframe PMS: Late luteal phase can reveal what isn't working in your life. When your tolerance for BS drops, you see clearly what needs to change. Your emotions aren't crazy, they're information. Be gentle with yourself.
 
Meal Timing
Metabolic Considerations: Insulin sensitivity is lowest. Blood sugar swings are common. Fasting DRAMATICALLY worsens PMS by adding cortisol stress on top of hormone withdrawal.
Guidance:
•	Eat regularly (every 3-4 hours)
•	Don't skip breakfast
•	Stabilise blood sugar with protein + complex carbs
•	Honour all hunger 
•	Satisfying snacks are necessary, not indulgent
 
Common Experiences
Physical:
•	Bloating: Progesterone causes water retention - this is temporary
•	Breast tenderness or swelling: Hormone fluctuations affect breast tissue
•	Acne breakouta: Androgens rise slightly as estrogen/progesterone drop
•	Digestive changes: Constipation or diarrhea (progesterone affects gut motility)
•	Headaches or migraines: Estrogen withdrawal is a trigger
•	Fatigue and heaviness: Your body is preparing to menstruate
Emotional:
•	Irritability and anger: Lower frustration tolerance is biological
•	Tearfulness: Progesterone withdrawal can trigger crying
•	Anxiety or doom feelings: Neurotransmitter shifts create this
•	Sadness or low mood: Serotonin is genuinely lower
When PMS Is Severe: If PMS significantly disrupts your life every cycle (can't work, relationships suffer, thoughts of self-harm), talk to a healthcare provider. PMDD (premenstrual dysphoric disorder) is a real medical condition that responds to treatment. You don't have to suffer through this.
